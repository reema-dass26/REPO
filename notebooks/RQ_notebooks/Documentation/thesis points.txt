Treat this as a visual enhancement issue:

✅ Keep the visualization feature

✅ Filter out example.org and blank node junk

✅ Add a 1-line comment in your code or thesis if needed:

“Graph may include system-generated blank nodes (e.g., example.org/...) — these are filtered out for clarity in visualization.”
 the example.com on the graphs isYour Position
If you're asked about it:

“The export functionality is correct and complete. The visualization is an enhancement, and any example.org nodes shown are system-generated blank nodes from RDF parsers like rdflib, not part of the original data.”

Visualization: Optional but Polished
Since your main task is to export the file, and the visualization is a bonus feature, the presence of example.org nodes:

Does not affect export correctness ✅

Could slightly confuse users viewing the graph ⚠️

Could reduce visual polish, especially if others interpret the nodes as user data ❌
