✅ Phase 1: Preparation
Goal: Understand and prepare your JSON structure for validation

Step 1.1 – Know Your Standards
Familiarize yourself with:

FAIR Principles

FAIR4ML

PROV-O Ontology

MLSEA (Metadata schema for ML experiments)

Step 1.2 – Organize Your Metadata
Make sure your metadata is:

Structured under categories like FAIR, FAIR4ML, PROV-O, MLSEA, and Croissant (already done ✅)

Properly flattened or nested as required (you've already implemented this in your JSON structure)

⚙️ Phase 2: Translate to RDF
Goal: Convert structured_metadata.json into RDF to prepare for validation.

You’ve already implemented this using rdflib:

Output: prov_JSONLD_export.jsonld and prov_RDFXML_export.rdf

✅ If this isn’t automated yet, wrap this step in a notebook or Streamlit utility.

🧪 Phase 3: Run Validations
Goal: Evaluate coverage and structural correctness

Step 3.1 – SHACL Validation
Use pySHACL to check conformance with schemas.

Define SHACL shape files:

fair_shapes.ttl

prov_shapes.ttl

mlsea_shapes.ttl

fair4ml_shapes.ttl

Example code:

python
Copy
Edit
from pyshacl import validate
conforms, report_graph, report_text = validate(
    data_graph='prov_JSONLD_export.jsonld',
    shacl_graph='fair_shapes.ttl',
    inference='rdfs',
    serialize_report_graph=True
)
print(report_text)
✅ Each shape file should contain rules like:

ttl
Copy
Edit
@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .

ex:ModelShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass prov:Entity ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path prov:wasGeneratedBy ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
    ] .
Step 3.2 – FAIR Evaluation
Use:

FAIR-Checker – Manual Web UI

FAIR Evaluation Services API – (programmatic, advanced)

🛠 You’ll upload or point to your JSON-LD and receive FAIRness scores.

📊 Phase 4: Calculate Coverage
Goal: Get metrics on your own metadata completion level

Build a Python function that:

Counts how many of the standard fields are present per strategy

Calculates % coverage per strategy

python
Copy
Edit
def evaluate_coverage(data, standard_fields):
    total = len(standard_fields)
    found = sum(1 for field in standard_fields if field in data and data[field] not in ["—", "None", None])
    return round(100 * found / total, 2)
Run this for:

python
Copy
Edit
fair_fields = ["dc:title", "dc:creator", "dcterms:hasVersion", "dcterms:modified", "dcat:landingPage"]
fair4ml_fields = ["fair4ml:trainingStartTime", "fair4ml:trainingEndTime", "fair4ml:modelID"]
prov_fields = ["prov:wasGeneratedBy", "prov:used", "prov:Activity"]
mlsea_fields = ["mlsea:accuracy", "mlsea:training_accuracy_score"]
🔁 Phase 5: Use Evaluation Results for Iteration
Based on SHACL violations and coverage gaps:

Improve metadata logging (e.g., during MLflow run)

Update structured_metadata.json

Re-run RDF export and validation

Log justifications or omissions for missing fields

🗂️ Bonus: Document and Share
Export validation reports (e.g., SHACL reports or FAIR scores)

Save alongside reproducibility files

Optionally publish your metadata + RDF exports on GitHub or Zenodo

Would you like help generating SHACL shape files for each standard so you can get started with validation immediately?
