✅ 1. Why This Structure?
You’ve grouped fields under key categories like FAIR, FAIR4ML, MLSEA, Croissant, and Uncategorized to reflect standardized metadata models. This supports:

Group	Based On	Purpose
FAIR	FAIR Principles and DCAT/DCMI	Dataset-level metadata (title, version, identifier)
FAIR4ML	FAIR4ML + PROV-O	Reproducibility and experiment trace metadata
MLSEA	ML Schema Evaluation & Justification Extension (MLSEA)	Evaluation metrics and researcher justifications
Croissant	ML-Schema / Croissant	Model metadata (architecture, learning algorithm, path, version, etc.)
Uncategorized	Internal / custom schema	Captures extra info not covered in above (session, git)

This structure promotes interoperability, reusability, and traceability of ML experiments.

. How to Evaluate the Metadata Coverage?
You can assess how complete your metadata is per standard using:

A. Checklists from standards (manual or scripted):
FAIR: FAIR-Checklist

PROV-O: PROV-O Core

MLSEA: From paper Table 1 & 2 (look at all mlsea:* fields and justification_*)

Croissant: Field Index

B. Open-source Tools:
You can use or adapt:

Tool	Purpose
FAIR Evaluator	Tests your metadata/DOI for FAIR compliance
RO-Crate Validator	If wrapping in RO-Crate for broader validation
Custom Python script	Check % of expected fields present per schem

2. Validate it using these open-source tools:
Tool	Purpose	How
RDFUnit	Validate RDF data against vocabularies (e.g. PROV, DCAT)	Run locally with SHACL/DQ constraints
FAIR Evaluator	Score metadata on FAIR compliance	Upload your JSON-LD or register your dataset
SHACL Validator	Check conformance of RDF/JSON-LD data to SHACL shapes	Paste your JSON-LD
RO-Crate Validator	Validate full dataset + metadata crates	If you extend your metadata into a RO-Crate format
