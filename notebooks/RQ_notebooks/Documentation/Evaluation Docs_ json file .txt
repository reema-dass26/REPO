✅ 1. Why This Structure?
You’ve grouped fields under key categories like FAIR, FAIR4ML, MLSEA, Croissant, and Uncategorized to reflect standardized metadata models. This supports:

Group	Based On	Purpose
FAIR	FAIR Principles and DCAT/DCMI	Dataset-level metadata (title, version, identifier)
FAIR4ML	FAIR4ML + PROV-O	Reproducibility and experiment trace metadata
MLSEA	ML Schema Evaluation & Justification Extension (MLSEA)	Evaluation metrics and researcher justifications
Croissant	ML-Schema / Croissant	Model metadata (architecture, learning algorithm, path, version, etc.)
Uncategorized	Internal / custom schema	Captures extra info not covered in above (session, git)

This structure promotes interoperability, reusability, and traceability of ML experiments.

. How to Evaluate the Metadata Coverage?
You can assess how complete your metadata is per standard using:

A. Checklists from standards (manual or scripted):
FAIR: FAIR-Checklist

PROV-O: PROV-O Core

MLSEA: From paper Table 1 & 2 (look at all mlsea:* fields and justification_*)

Croissant: Field Index

B. Open-source Tools:
You can use or adapt:

Tool	Purpose
FAIR Evaluator	Tests your metadata/DOI for FAIR compliance
RO-Crate Validator	If wrapping in RO-Crate for broader validation
Custom Python script	Check % of expected fields present per schem

2. Validate it using these open-source tools:
Tool	Purpose	How
RDFUnit	Validate RDF data against vocabularies (e.g. PROV, DCAT)	Run locally with SHACL/DQ constraints
FAIR Evaluator	Score metadata on FAIR compliance	Upload your JSON-LD or register your dataset
SHACL Validator	Check conformance of RDF/JSON-LD data to SHACL shapes	Paste your JSON-LD
RO-Crate Validator	Validate full dataset + metadata crates	If you extend your metadata into a RO-Crate format


Recommended Open-Source Validators for PROV-O and RDF Data
1. pySHACL – Python SHACL Validator
Description: A pure Python module that allows for the validation of RDF graphs against SHACL shapes. It uses the rdflib library and supports OWL2 RL reasoning.

Use Case: Ideal for integrating into Python-based workflows for validating RDF data against SHACL constraints.

2. SHACL Validator by ISAITB – Web and Command-Line Application
Description: A web application to validate RDF data against SHACL shapes. It provides a reusable core with configuration options and supports validation via web interface, REST API, and command-line.

Use Case: Suitable for both interactive and automated validation processes.

3. Validata – RDF Validator Using Shape Expressions
Description: An intuitive, standalone web-based tool to help build valid RDF documents by validating against preset schemas written in the Shape Expressions (ShEx) language.

Use Case: Useful for validating RDF data against ShEx schemas in a user-friendly interface.

4. ProvValidator – PROV Validation Tool
Description: Performs a series of tests to check the validity of an in-memory PROV representation and returns a validation report listing identified issues.

Use Case: Specifically designed for validating PROV data models.

5. W3C RDF Validation Service
Description: A service that allows you to paste an RDF/XML document and have it checked for validity. It provides options to display the result as triples and/or a graph.

Use Case: Quick validation of RDF/XML documents for syntax and structure.
